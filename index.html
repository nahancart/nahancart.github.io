        <p>Hello, I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at University College London</p>

        <p>My interests are in microeconomic theory with a focus on Information and Behavioural Economics.</p>

        <p>You can find information on my research and my <a href="documents/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> here.</p>

	      <p>Job Market Paper: <b>Optimal Menus of Tests</b> (Draft coming soon)</p>
	      <p align="justify"><emph>Abstract:</emph><br>
	I study the optimal design of menus of tests. Prior to taking a binary decision, accept or reject a privately informed agent, a decision-maker (DM) can perform one test from a restricted set. For example, the restriction can come from information processing or technological constraints. The DM wants to accept a subset of types whereas the agent always wants to be accepted. Instead of choosing the test himself, the DM let the agent choose a test from a menu. The choice itself then serves as an additional dimension for information revelation. I characterise when a menu is optimal and show that the DM does not benefit from committing to an action. Using these results, I show conditions under which the DM wants or does not want to include strictly less informative test in the menu. I also define an order on tests that characterises which tests are part of an optimal menu. Finally, I demonstrate in an application how the need to provide incentives for self-selection in a menu hinders the ability to learn from the test itself.</br></p>

<p align="justify">emph>Abstract:</emph><br>I consider a model of monopoly pricing where a risk-neutral firm makes an offer to a buyer with reference-dependent preferences. The reference point is the ex-ante probability of trade and the buyer exhibits an attachment effect: the higher his expectations to buy, the higher his willingness-to-pay. When the buyer’s valuation is private information, a unique equilibrium exists where the firm plays a mixed strategy and its profits are the same as in the reference-independent benchmark. The equilibrium always entails inefficiencies: even as the firm’s information converges to complete information, it mixes on a non-vanishing support and the probability of no trade is greater than zero. Finally, I show that when the firm can obtain costless signals on the buyer’s valuation, it can do strictly better than in the reference-independent benchmark by leveraging the uncertainty generated by a noisy learning strategy. However, this advantage vanishes as the attachment effect grows large.</br></p>
